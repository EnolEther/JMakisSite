<h1>About</h1>

<p>My Name is John Makis. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a BSc. in Chemistry. I really enjoyed the academic atmosphere and the challenges of scientific research. I participated in the Freshman Research Initiative under the guidance of Dr. Keith J. Stevenson in the Nanomaterials for Chemical Catalysis group. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the group and I am grateful for the amazing opportunities it brought. I later went on to work under Dr. Philip D. Magnus learning the techniques necessary for natural product synthesis. My experience with the group taught me many valuable skills. Through my experience with research and coursework I developed a passion for organic synthesis and instrumental analysis. The ingenuity and cleverness of chemists throughout history is inspiring and it paints a fascinating tale of progress. In the future, I want to return the the academic life to obtain a PhD within the field of chemistry.</p>
<p>Most of my work experience has come from research and peer mentoring (similar to teaching assistant). I spent a lot of time working in research groups at UT. I spent my first stint doing quantitative physical chemistry on nanoparticle catalysts. I was able to present my research at a national ACS convention and I co-wrote a manuscript published by The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. My second stint I developed a love for organic chemistry (specifically natural products synthesis and methodologies) and the bench-work associated with it. Working with my hands, especially in the lab, is a passion of mine. I also have interned in an office doing filing, data entry, packing and shipping, and any other tasks that needed to be done.</p>
<p>Outside the academic life I enjoy playing electric guitar which has been a long time hobby of mine. I also developed a love for photography and have included examples of my work on this website through the use of the Flickr APIs. I have grown fond of the fun to be had in Austin like the ACL Music Festival, motor sports at the Circuit of the Americas, and enjoying the cold springs along the greenbelt to cool off in the hot summers. Growing up I had access to many of the emerging technologies. I remember using PCs in the early 90s to play educational games. And when Intel's Pentium 4 processors came out I built my first PC from individual parts and have since assembled each of my subsequent PCs. I have since grown to enjoy playing computer games and experimenting with computer programming.</p>
