# My Notes on using git

Set up repository by initializing git in project directory

~~~ bash
$:>  git init
~~~

Remember to set up .gitignore and README.md

To add files to repository

~~~ bash
$:>  git add . 				# adds all files
$:>  git add fName
$:>  git add dirName
~~~

To commit working branch to master branch (-m allows required commit message to be included in the command line)

~~~ bash
$:>  git commit -m "Present tense update note"
~~~

To see the commit log

~~~ bash
$:>  git log				# quit by typing 'q'
~~~

To setup a repository (sets up main master branch at the repository)

~~~ bash
$:>  git remote add origin URL
~~~

To push local repository to the main master branch (depending on the system some arguments can be omitted).

~~~ bash
$:>  git push -u origin master
$:>  git push
~~~

To recover from the previous commit (-f is force overwrite)

~~~ bash
$:>  git checkout -f
~~~

To begin a local branch

~~~ bash
$:>  git checkout -b branchName
~~~

To see local branches for current project

~~~ bash
$:>  git branch
~~~

If you want to conserve the master branch and have a backup of the branch in the repository you push the branch to the repository and it will keep each branch separate

~~~ bash
$:>  git checkout -b mynewfeature
$:>  git push -u origin mynewfeature
~~~

To commit all modifications to existing files or those that are generated by git unix commands

~~~ bash
$:>  git commit -a -m "Update note"
~~~

To merge branches back into the master branch (after branch is committed)

~~~ bash
$:>  git checkout master
$:>  git merge branchName
~~~

To delete a branch that has been merged

~~~ bash
$:>  git branch -d branchName
~~~

In the case of an irrecoverable branch the -D flag will allow the branch to be deleted without merging changes to the master branch.

~~~ bash
$:>  git checkout -b newBranch
  # newBranch was irrecoverably messed up
$:>  git add .
$:>  git commit -a -m "Major screw up, branch lost"
$:>  git checkout master
$:>  git branch -D newBranch
~~~

## Other useful git information
[Git Reference](http://gitref.org/)

Git has it's own versions of Unix commands

~~~ bash
$:>  git mv source target
~~~

Git provides a way of making internal aliases, for example:

~~~ bash
$:>  git config --global alias.co checkout
~~~
